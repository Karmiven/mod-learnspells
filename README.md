# Features
The module will give players new spells when leveling up or when entering the world.

The spells included are class spells, talent ranks, proficiencies and mounts.

All the features are enabled, or disabled, through the configuration - allowing a user to only use the features they want.

- It's something I *really* want or that I think should be included with the module.
